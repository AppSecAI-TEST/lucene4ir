\subsection{Challenges and Opportunities}
During the workshop the challenges and opportunities between academia and industry were discussed. Below is a summary of the main points of stemming from the discussion.

The first challenge is the lack of good real-world test data for researchers. This is something that academics expects companies to provide. 

Also, if the industry can communicate current problems they had, academics can provide solutions which can be feed back to industry as a potential solution in the future. 

For example, industry needs internal indicators of utility within an organisation of search to measure loss or gain. 

Such metrics can be developed by academics and provided to industry. 

In particular when the search domain is getting further apart from traditional ``Site Search'' and goes towards ``Enterprise Search'' which the data set are not that massive, hence ``Google'' approaches might not be applicable. 

However, the only scenario in which this situation can be realised is that a client come forward with a funding for investing in solving a challenging problem that requires an academic to do so, but this does not happen that often. 
In other scenarios, from industry point of view, communicating their current challenges might be difficult due to the Non-disclosure agreement (NDA).

It was also mentioned that there is a need for a common open source platform that can be used for teaching and learning purpose. 
In order to use Lucene for this purpose, there is a need for a better and general documentation which is not bound to any specific features that is version dependent. 

But the question was ``whether documentation should come from academia to industry or vice versa?''
It seems like industry people don't have time to create the required documentation and they would expect academics to provide that. 

Therefore, there is a need to access funds to create teaching and resource material as well as contribute to the open source materials. 

This leads us to the next challenge which is ``how industry and academics can collaborate using some funding like knowledge transfer?''

It was pointed out that there is time pressure and lack of expertise to apply for grant applications in the industry and academics can provide the required expertise on this matter. 

Also there is a huge amount of paperwork involved in getting a grant which makes it unappealing for companies. 

The final point discussed were the graduate attributes and the skills required by Computer Scientist and Software Engineering Graduates working in information retrieval, text mining and big data. The obvious and core skills required in terms of being able to : (i) develop high quality, robust code, (ii) understand and think about complex systems/problems, (iii) communicate, discuss and resolve issues and (iv) have a good understanding of software engineering principles and practices, were seen as mandatory. More specifically to the field of search and big data, industry participants felt that there was a lack of skill graduates that knew about search technologies, how to process large scale data sets, and how to work with big (text) data. They expected candidates to understand more about the processes and core concepts of search and big data - to be able to describe it at a conceptual level, at least - but with ideally some practical skills (i.e. Lucene, Solr, Spark, Pig, etc). It was noted that the learning curve can be very steep when picking such technologies - but such skills are seen to be increasingly valuable by employers. For example, Lucene is a very large and complex project, that has evolved over years, so it can feel very opaque and daunting to begin with, however, given that it one of the largest OS toolkits for information and data mining and retrieval it is a skill worth learning. It was felt that there was a strong need for developing more training and resources for beginners to learn how to use such toolkits - and this was seen to be an area where more investment from funding agencies and universities could be directed. 

%In addition, many open source search companies are small and therefore they find it hard to support apprenticeships, internships, etc.
